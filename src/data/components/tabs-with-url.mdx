title: How to create tabs with URL navigation
group: tab
---

Creating tabs with URL navigation doesn't require much extra work from creating [standard tabs](/examples/tabs), all you need is a way for Alpine JS to read the hash in the URL and set the active tab value.

Here's what the example is using:

```html
x-init="activeTab = window.location.hash?.replace('#', '') || 'details'"
```

Which is using the optional chaining method on `.replace()` for the hash, this is the equivalent of writing:

```html
window.location.hash ? window.location.hash.replace('#', '') : 'details'
```

Both approaches work, the first one is a little neater.

As the preview is in an `<iframe>` you won't see the URL changing. However, if you to the [component code](/components/tabs-with-url.html) for the preview you will see it working.
